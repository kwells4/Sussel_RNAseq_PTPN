# Sample sheet. This is the path to the sample sheet. Should be a tab delimited
# tsv file with the one column titled "sample" and a second column titled
# "fastq1" with filenames relating to each sample. If paired end sequencing was
# done, another columen should be titled "fastq2" with filenames for read 2.
# If spike-ins were included another column can be spike-in with True/False
# values and you must include paths for the COMBINED_GENOME and COMBINED_GTF
SAMPLE_TABLE: 
   "files/samples.tsv"

# Project the name of the project
PROJECT:

# Reference. This should be the path to a directory created using star
GENOME:


# Combined genome if spike-ins were used. This should be a path to a combined index using
# star. Can leave blank if no spike-ins were used.
COMBINED_GENOME:

# GTF. This is a path to the gtf file. Should match the genome fa used
GTF:

# Combined gtf if spike-ins were used. Should match the genome fa used.
# Can leave blank if no spike-ins were used.
COMBINED_GTF:

# Path to results directory
RESULTS:
  "results"

# Path to adaptors file. This is included in the bbtools package under .../bbmap/resources/adaptors.fa
