# PTPN Knockout Project
Analysis of the PTPN knockout experiment

## Aims
1. Analyze the transcriptional differences between PTPN knockout and WT mice following proinflammatory cytokin treatment for 24 hours.

## Samples
1. WT (PTPN2 flox/flox) without cytokine treatment
2. PTPN2 KO (PTPN2 flox/flox, ins Cre) without cytokine treatment
3. WT (PTPN2 flox/flox) with 24 hours of cytokine treatment
4. PTPN2 KO (PTPN2 flox/flox, ins Cre) with 24 hours of cytokine treament

## Comparisions
1. WT vs KO (controls)
2. WT vs cytokine treated WT
3. KO vs cytokine treated KO
4. cytokine treated WT vs cytokine treated KO
